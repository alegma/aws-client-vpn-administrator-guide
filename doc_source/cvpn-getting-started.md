# Getting Started with Client VPN<a name="cvpn-getting-started"></a>

The following tasks help you become familiar with Client VPN\. In this tutorial, you will create a Client VPN endpoint that does the following:
+ Provides access to a single VPC\.
+ Provides access to the internet\.
+ Use mutual authentication\. For more information, see [Mutual Authentication](authentication-authrization.md#mutual)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="cvpn-getting-started-prereq"></a>

To complete this getting started tutorial, you need the following:
+ The permissions required to work with Client VPN endpoints\.
+ A VPC with at least one subnet, an internet gateway, and a route to the internet gateway\.

## Step 1: Generate Server and Client Certificates and Keys<a name="cvpn-getting-started-certs"></a>

This tutorial uses mutual authentication\. With mutual authorization, Client VPN uses certificates to perform authentication between the client and the server\.

For the steps to generate the server and client certificates and keys, see [Mutual Authentication](authentication-authrization.md#mutual)\.

## Step 2: Create a Client VPN Endpoint<a name="cvpn-getting-started-endpoint"></a>

When you create a Client VPN endpoint, you create the VPN construct to which clients can connect to establish a VPN connection\.

After you create the Client VPN endpoint, take note of the following:
+ The initial state of the Client VPN endpoint is `pending-associate`\. Clients can only establish a VPN connection after you associate at least one target network\.
+ You receive a Client VPN endpoint DNS name\. This is the DNS name clients use to establish a VPN connection\.
+ You can download the Client VPN endpoint configuration file\. You can provide this file to your clients who need to connect to the VPN\.

**To create a Client VPN endpoint \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints** and choose **Create Client VPN Endpoint\.**

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter a brief description for the Client VPN endpoint\.

1. For **Client IPv4 CIDR**, specify the IP address range, in CIDR notation, from which to assign client IP addresses\.
**Note**  
The IP address range cannot overlap with the target network or any of the routes that will be associated with the Client VPN endpoint\. The client CIDR range must have a block size that is between /16 and /22 and not overlap with VPC CIDR or any other route in the route table\.
**Important**  
The IP address range cannot be changed after the Client VPN endpoint has been created\.

1. For **Server certificate ARN**, specify the ARN for the TLS certificate to be used by the server\. Clients use the server certiﬁcate to authenticate the Client VPN endpoint to which they are connecting\. 
**Note**  
The server certificate must be provisioned in AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\)\.

1. Specify the authentication method to be used to authenticate clients when they establish a VPN connection\. To use mutual certificate authentication, select **Use mutual authentication**, and then for **Client certificate ARN**, specify the ARN of the client certificate generated in Step 1\.

1. Specify whether to log data about client connections using Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. For **Do you want to log the details on client connections?**, do one of the following:
   + To enable client connection logging, choose **Yes**, for **CloudWatch Logs log group name** enter the name of the log group to use, and for **CloudWatch Logs log stream name**, enter the name of the log stream to use\.
   + To disable client connection logging, choose **No**\.

1. \(Optional\) Specify which DNS servers to use for DNS resolution\. To use custom DNS servers, for **DNS Server 1 IP address** and **DNS Server 2 IP address**, specify the IP addresses of the DNS servers to use\. To use a VPC DNS Server, for either **DNS Server 1 IP address** or **DNS Server 2 IP address**, specify the IP addresses, add the VPC DNS server IP address\.
**Note**  
Ensure that the DNS servers can be reached by clients\.

1. \(Optional\) By default, the Client VPN server uses the `UDP` transport protocol\. To use the `TCP` transport protocol instead, for **Transport Protocol**, select **TCP**\.
**Note**  
UDP typically offers better performance than TCP\.

1. Choose **Create Client VPN Endpoint**\.

After you create the client vpn endpoint, the console displays the DNS name, for example, " cvpn\-endpoint\-0102bc4c2e49f1e44\.prod\.clientvpn\.us\-west\-2\.amazonaws\.com"\. When you need to specify the DNS name, you must specify a random string in front of the displayed name so that the format is “\[*random string*\]\.displayed DNS name, for example, “asdfa\.cvpn\-endpoint\-0102bc4c2e49f1e44\.prod\.clientvpn\.us\-west\-2\.amazonaws\.com"\.

## Step 3: Enable VPN Connectivity for Clients<a name="cvpn-getting-started-target"></a>

To enable clients to establish a VPN session, you must associate a target network with the Client VPN endpoint\. A target network is a subnet in a VPC\. 

When you associate the first subnet with the Client VPN endpoint, the following happens:
+ The state of the Client VPN endpoint changes to `available`\. Clients can now establish a VPN connection, but they cannot access any resources in the VPC until you add the authorization rules\.
+ The local route of the VPC is automatically added to the Client VPN endpoint route table\. 
+ The VPC's default security group is automatically applied for the subnet association\. You can modify the security group after associating the subnet\.

**To associate a subnet with the Client VPN endpoint \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint with which to associate the subnet and choose **Associations**, **Associate**\.

1. For **VPC**, choose the VPC in which the subnet is provisioned\.
**Note**  
For the first subnet you associate, you can choose any subnet in any VPC that exists in the same account as the Client VPN endpoint\. After you associate the first subnet with the Client VPN endpoint, all further subnet associations must be from the same VPC, but they must belong to different Availability Zones\.

1. For **Subnet to associate**, choose the subnet to associate with the Client VPN endpoint\.

1. Choose **Associate**\.

## Step 4: Authorize Clients to Access a Network<a name="cvpn-getting-started-rules"></a>

To authorize clients to access the VPC in which the associated subnet is located, you must create an authorization rule\. The authorization rule specifies which clients have access to the VPC\. In this tutorial, we grant access to all users\.

**To add an authorization rule to the target network**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the authorization rule, choose **Authorization**, and then choose **Authorize ingress**\.

1. For **Destination network**, enter the IP address, in CIDR notation, of the network for which you want to allow access\.

1. Specify which clients are allowed to access the specified network\. To grant access to all users, for **For grant access to**, choose **Allow access to all users**\.

1. For **Description**, enter a brief description of the authorization rule\.

1. Choose **Add authorization rule**\.

## Step 5: \(Optional\) Enable Access to Additional Networks<a name="cvpn-getting-started-routes"></a>

You can enable access to additional networks connected to the VPC, such as AWS services, peered VPCs, and on\-premises networks\. For each additional network, you must add a route to the network and configure an authorization rule to give clients access\.

In this tutorial, we add a route to the internet and add an authorization rule that grants access to all users\.

**To enable access to additional networks \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the route, choose **Route Table**, and then choose **Create Route**\.

1. For **Route destination**, enter `0.0.0.0/0`\.

1. For **Target VPC Subnet ID**, specify the ID of the subnet through which to route traffic\.

1. For **Description**, enter a brief description for the route\.

1. Choose **Create Route**\.

1. Add an authorization rule for the network to specify which clients have access\. Perform the steps at [Step 4: Authorize Clients to Access a Network](#cvpn-getting-started-rules), for **Step 5** enter `0.0.0.0/0`, and for **Step 6** choose **Allow access to all users**\.

1. Ensure that the security group, associated with subnet you are routing traffic through, allows inbound and outbound traffic to and from the internet\. To do this, add inbound and outbound rules that allow traffic to and from 0.0.0.0/0\.

## Step 6: Download the Client VPN Endpoint Configuration File<a name="cvpn-getting-started-config"></a>

The final step is to download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file\. The configuration file includes the Client VPN endpoint and certificate information required to establish a VPN connection\. You must provide this file to the clients who need to connect to the Client VPN endpoint to establish a VPN connection\. The client uploads this file into their VPN client application\.

**To download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint for which to download the Client VPN configuration file and choose **Download Client Configuration**\.

1. Copy the client certificate and key to the same folder as the downloaded Client VPN endpoint configuration file\. The client certificate and key can be found in the following locations in the cloned OpenVPN easy\-rsa repo:
   + Client certificate — `easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/issued/client1.domain.tld.crt`
   + Client key — `easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/private/client1.domain.tld.key`

1. Open the Client VPN endpoint configuration file using your preferred editor and add the following to the end of the file\.

   ```
   cert /path/client1.domain.tld.crt
   key /path/client1.domain.tld.key
   ```

1. Save and close the Client VPN endpoint configuration file\.

1. Distribute the Client VPN endpoint configuration file to your clients\.

**To download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file \(AWS CLI\)**

1. Download the Client VPN endpoint configuration file\.

   ```
   $ aws ec2 export-client-vpn-client-configuration --client-vpn-endpoint-id endpoint_id --output text>client-config.ovpn
   ```

1. Copy the client certificate and key, which were generated in Step 1, to the same folder as the downloaded Client VPN endpoint configuration file\. The client certificate and key can be found in the following locations in the cloned OpenVPN easy\-rsa repo :
   + Client certificate — `easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/issued/client1.domain.tld.crt`
   + Client key — `easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/private/client1.domain.tld.key`

1. Append the client certificate and key to the Client VPN endpoint configuration file\.

   ```
   $ cat >> client-config.ovpn
   cert /path/client1.domain.tld.crt
   key /path/client1.domain.tld.key
   ```

1. Distribute the Client VPN endpoint configuration file to your clients\.
